		"Anxiety suppression (also known as anxiolysis or minimal sedation) is medically recognized as a partial to complete suppression of a personâ€™s ability to feel anxiety, general unease, and negative feelings of both psychological and physiological tension. The experience of this effect may decrease anxiety-related behaviours such as restlessness, muscular tension, rumination, and panic attacks. This typically results in feelings of extreme calmness and relaxation.",
